## Overview

This discusses idioms that lexicalize (at least) a verb and a complement noun. In the literature, various subcategories of VP idioms are known as Verb-Noun Constructions (VNCs), Light Verb Constructions (LVCs), Support Verb Constructions, and phrasal idioms. Such constructions possess varying degrees of fixedness/productivity.

## Examples

### _take_ LVCs

- take a walk (swim, shower, break, ...): any eventive noun for a durative activity with one (non-denoted) participant. AmE. (TODO: check CU work on 'take' LVCs)
- take a {picture,photo}

### _attention_ SVCs

- pay attention (to NP)
- give one's attention to NP
- give NP one's attention
- pay no {heed, mind}

### phrasal idioms

- kick the bucket
- spill the beans [decomposable]
